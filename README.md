# personal-website

1. Create and switch to a new feature branch locally.
2. Think about the content you want to put on your website and its structure.
3. Start to put your ideas into code, giving your website structure and content. Use semantic HTML whenever possible. Work on one feature (on the respective branch) after another.
4. Commit your work to the feature branch whenever a new part of your website is done.
5. Create a pull request on GitHub. Send a link to the pull request to the Slack channel of your course and request a review. While you wait, review someone else's pull request.
6. After committing the requested changes and getting approval for your pull request, merge your feature branch into the main branch.
